The face is one of the easiest ways to distinguish the individual identity of each other. Face recognition is a personal identification system that uses personal characteristics of a personto identify the 
person's identity. Human face recognition procedure basically consists of two phases, namely face detection, where this process takes place very rapidly in humans, except under conditionswhere the object is 
located at a short distance away, the next is the introduction, which recognize a face as individuals. Stage is then replicated and developed as a model for facialimage recognition (face recognition) is one 
of the muchstudied biometrics technology and developed by experts. There are two kinds of methods that are currently popular in developed face recognition pattern namely, Eigenface method and Fisherface 
method. Facial image recognition Eigenface method is based on the reduction of facedimensional space using PrincipalComponent Analysis (PCA) for facial features. The main purpose of the use of PCA on face 
recognition using Eigen faces was formed (face space) by finding the eigenvector correspondingto the largest eigenvalue of the face image. The area of this project face detection system with face recognition 
is Image processing. The software requirements for this project is MATLAB software.

In sensitive area where generally no one is allowed So first we will detect the motion after The motion detection it automatically revoke the functions for face detection.The identification of human can be 
done through the face of human. So first we detect face of human after that, Does that face has mask or it is naked face. If it is naked face check in our database that does that human is present in database 
or someone else. Real time security face recognition is part of the field of biometrics. Biometrics is the ability for a computer to recognize a human through a unique physical trait. Face recognition 
provides the capability for the computer to recognize a human by facial characteristics. Today, biometrics is one of the fastest growing fields inadvanced technology. Predictionsindicate a biometrics 
explosion in the next century, to authenticate identities and avoid and unauthorized access to networks, database and facilities.

A facial recognition device is a device that takes an image or a video of a humanface and compares it to other image faces in a database. The structure, shape and proportions of the faces are compared 
during the face recognition steps. In addition, distance between the eyes, nose, mouth and jaw, upper outlines of the eye sockets, the sides of the mouth, location of the nose and eyes, and the area 
surrounding the check bones are also compared. When using a facial recognition program, several pictures of the person must be taken at different angles and withdifferent facial expressions. At timeof 
verification and identification the subject stands in front of the camera for a few seconds, and then the image is compared to those that have been previously recorded. Facial recognition is widely used 
because of its benefits. The advantages of facial recognition are that it is not intrusive, can be done from a faraway distance even without the person being aware that he/she is being scanned. Such thing 
is needed in banks or government offices for example, and this is what makes facial recognition systems betterthan other biometric techniques in that they can be used for surveillance purposes like searching for
wanted criminals, suspected terrorists, or missing children. Face recognitiondevices are most beneficial to use for facial authentication than for identification purposes, because it is easy to 
alter someoneâ€™s face, and because the person can disguiseusing a mask. Environment is also a consideration as well as subject motion and focus onthe camera. Facial recognition, when used
in combination with another biometric method, can improve verification and identification results dramatically.
